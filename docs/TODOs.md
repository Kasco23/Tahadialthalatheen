Pending Improvements and Fixes for Tahadialthalatheen

This document collects concrete tasks to address the outstanding issues in the Tahadialthalatheen project. Each task includes sufficient context and guidance so that GitHub¬†Copilot (via context7, sequentialthinking, supabase and other mcps) can propose meaningful code changes without guessing.

‚ú®¬†**Visual polish**
**Join page tunnel background**

- [ ] The current tunnel effect on the Join page is built with Tailwind gradients and pseudo‚Äëelements but doesn't evoke a football player tunnel. See the placeholder comments in src/pages/Join.tsx and the custom backgrounds defined in tailwind.config.js (tunnel-gradient and champions-tunnel). Swap this out for a realistic tunnel:
  - [ ] Source a high‚Äëquality stadium tunnel photo (copyright‚Äëfree) and add it to the public folder; or, alternatively, design a new CSS composition using perspective lines, dark walls and light at the end to mimic a tunnel. Remove the commented placeholders.

  - [ ] Apply the image via a bg-[url('/path/to/tunnel.jpg')] class or define a new Tailwind background (e.g. player-tunnel) in tailwind.config.js.

  - [ ] Ensure the overlay layer still darkens the background so text remains legible.

**Lobby dugout background**

- [ ] The lobby currently uses a ‚Äúdugout‚Äù effect defined in src/index.css with a linear gradient and repeating stripe pattern for seats. Users report it looks more like a gradient than a bench. Replace this with a more convincing dugout/bench illustration: Users report it looks more like a gradient than a bench. Replace this with a more convincing dugout/bench illustration:
  - [ ] Introduce a realistic bench texture or image (again placed in public) and use background-image with background-size: cover so seats look like actual benches.

  - [ ] Retain the lighting and canopy pseudo‚Äëelements if desired, but adjust colours so they better match real dugouts (metal or leather seats, darker tones).

  - [ ] Test responsiveness on mobile: the bench area should compress gracefully without cutting off players.

üèÅ¬†**Team and league logos**
**Display league logos in logo selectors**

- [ ] Supabase function list-logos returns a leagueLogo property for each category folder, but the React component LogoSelector.tsx maps the response into an array of leagues without keeping the league‚Äôs logo. Update the mapping logic:
  - [ ] Include leagueLogo as a field in the League type and assign it when building leaguesArray.

  - [ ] In the UI, render the league logo to the left of the league‚Äôs displayName in the collapsible header of each league. Use an <img> with fixed width/height and alt text, wrapped in a flex container for alignment.

  - [ ] Rename any references to ‚Äúcategories‚Äù in the UI to ‚ÄúLeagues‚Äù so the terminology matches the data returned by Supabase. Check the search field placeholder and headings.

**Improve team logo picker ergonomics**

- [ ] On small screens the FlagSelector and LogoSelector overlap; the flag search input disappears behind the logo picker. Fix the layout so selecting a flag doesn‚Äôt hide the search bar:
  - [ ] In Join.tsx, wrap the flag and logo selectors in a responsive flex container. On desktop, show them side by side; on mobile (<768¬†px) stack them vertically using flex-col and add space-y-4.

  - [ ] When a user clicks into the flag selector, expand it into a modal or dropdown that overlays above the logo selector instead of pushing behind it. You can achieve this by setting position: relative on the parent and z-index on the expanding panel. Hide the logo picker while the flag dropdown is open if necessary.

  - [ ] Ensure the search input in FlagSelector stays visible and that scroll works properly when the list is long. Consider adding max-h-48 and overflow-y-auto to the dropdown.

  - [ ] Add appropriate data-testid attributes for Playwright tests (e.g. data-testid="flag-selector" and data-testid="logo-selector").

üìπ **Daily.co integration**
**Eliminate duplicate DailyIframe instances**

- The lobby currently mixes two different Daily integration patterns. In Lobby.tsx a call object is created with DailyIframe.createCallObject(), while elsewhere (DailyJoinButton.tsx) the app uses useDaily() and relies on a <DailyProvider> wrapper. This duplication leads to the runtime error ‚ÄúDuplicate¬†DailyIframe¬†instances are not allowed.‚Äù

- [ ] To fix this, follow the pattern from the provided daily-react-kitchen-sink example: create the call object once via useCallFrame (from @daily-co/daily-react) and pass it into a DailyProvider. Then consume the call via useDaily() throughout your components. Concretely:

1. [ ] Remove DailyIframe.createCallObject() from Lobby.tsx. Instead, import useCallFrame and call it with an options object that sets the Daily room URL and iframeStyle. For example:

```tsx
const wrapperRef = useRef<HTMLDivElement>(null);
const callFrame = useCallFrame({
  parentElRef: wrapperRef,
  options: {
    url: dailyRoom.room_url,
    token: tokenResponse.token,
    iframeStyle: { width: "100%", height: "80vh" },
  },
  shouldCreateInstance: () =>
    Boolean(dailyRoom?.room_url && wrapperRef.current),
});
```

2. [ ] Wrap the portion of the Lobby page responsible for video calls with <DailyProvider callObject={callFrame}> and render the video UI (grid, controls, etc.) inside that provider.
3. [ ] Call callFrame.join() when the user chooses to enter the call. For example, in handleJoinDailyCall call callFrame.join({ url: dailyRoom.room_url, token: tokenResponse.token, userName: participantName }). Listen for joined-meeting and left-meeting events via useDailyEvent hooks instead of manually attaching listeners.
4. [ ] Remove DailyJoinButton.tsx or refactor it to use useDaily(); do not manually call daily?.join() if the call has already been joined by the call frame.
5. [ ] Ensure that you destroy the call frame on component unmount by using the cleanup function returned from useCallFrame, or call callFrame.destroy() in a useEffect cleanup.
6. [ ] Update any other components that directly use DailyIframe to instead use the context provided by DailyProvider.
       This approach mirrors the Prebuilt example from the kitchen‚Äësink demo, where a call frame is created once and passed into a provider. It prevents multiple DailyIframe instances from being created, eliminating the error.

**Token management**

- [ ] The current implementation keeps token expiry and refresh logic in DailyJoinButton.tsx. When restructuring around useCallFrame, centralise this logic in a custom hook (e.g. useDailyToken) that:
  - [ ] Requests a new token via createDailyToken() when needed.
  - [ ] Stores the token and its expiry in Jotai atoms (dailyTokenAtom, dailyTokenExpiryAtom)
  - [ ] Automatically refreshes the token a few minutes before expiry.
  - [ ] Exposes isTokenExpiring, refreshToken() and the current token for components that need them.
- [ ] Remove token handling from UI components; they should simply call join() with the provided token.

üß™ **Playwright and other tests**

- [ ] Implement or fix Playwright tests in tests/e2e/ to validate the new logo picker and Daily integration:
  - [ ] A test should navigate to /join/[session-code], select a league and a team (e.g. Real¬†Madrid), verify the logo displays in the picker and persists through joining.
  - [ ] Another test should ensure spaces in folder names (e.g. La¬†Liga) are handled correctly.
  - [ ] Additional tests can cover joining and leaving video calls without duplicate instances and verifying token refresh.
- [ ] Use the @supabase mcps to seed your test Supabase storage with a few logo files during the test setup.

üß†¬†**Other notes**

- [ ] Review and clean up any unused imports, variables or commented code in the affected files.
- [ ] Clean up unused background placeholders in Join.tsx and Lobby.tsx; remove large blocks of commented JSX that don‚Äôt render anything. This will make the code easier for Copilot to navigate.
- [ ] Ensure all network requests (Supabase and Netlify functions) handle errors gracefully and set loading states appropriately.
- [ ] When adding new images, update the content security policy in netlify.toml if required.
